# 🦅 CERBERUS-AGI 2026
# Human-Like, Long-Running iOS Automation — Built for AGI Control 🧠🤖

🎬 See VIDEO.mp4 to watch CERBERUS in action.

CERBERUS-AGI is a high-stability iOS automation framework engineered to run for months without interruption.
It focuses on human-like interaction, native system-level reliability, and script based/AI-driven execution.
Most iOS automation tools fail under long runtimes.
CERBERUS solves this with TrollStore execution, a dedicated admin daemon, and a self-clean+healing architecture.

# ✨ About the Project - About Me

CERBERUS was crafted over 5+ years work. Driven by one obsession: PURE stability. 
The only way this can be achieved is to be as native as posible but still remaining truly powerfull.

# 🧱 Design Philosophy — 5 Core Pillars

🪶 Extreme Lightweight Efficiency
~20MB total footprint · RAM-first design · minimal storage impact

💎 Native Stability
Powered by TrollStore + hardened Dopamine admin daemon

🤖 AI-Ready Intelligence
Bridging static scripts and AI-driven decision making

👻 Human-Like Execution
Micro-jitter, organic delays, taps & swipes like a real user

🌳 AutoClean / AutoHeal
Always-on memory cleanup + dual self-healing protocols

🌌 Introduction — Beyond Coordinate Clicking

CERBERUS is not a simple autoclicker.
It understands screens, context, and intent, not just coordinates.

2️⃣ Automation Modes

🛠️ Manual Mode
🧠 AI Mode

🌉 AI Integration — Giving AI “Eyes & Hands”

CERBERUS acts as a kinetic bridge 🌉 between iOS and AI systems.

It can:

👁️ Read the screen (OCR)

🚀 Launch apps

🖐️ Tap, swipe & gesture

⚙️ Execute shortcuts

🧱 Run persistently in background

This allows AI models like GPT-4o Vision / Gemini / Claude to transform natural language intent into real physical iOS actions.

👔💼 Your iPhone or iPad becomes an autonomous digital worker.

💓 Potential Use Cases (Examples)

📈 Trader Agent
AI-driven trading based on charts, news & live app data

🎮 Game Automation
Human-like farming, healing & repetitive gameplay

🚀 Growth Engine
Social workflows executed physically — not fragile APIs

📅 Digital Secretary
Automates repetitive iOS tasks & daily workflows

🧠 AI Bridge
Allows AI to solve CAPTCHAs, puzzles & dynamic UI logic

👻 Examples only — legality depends on your jurisdiction.

⚡ Automation Modes

🛠️ Manual Mode
Deterministic scripts · fully offline capable

🪄 AI Mode
AI interprets English commands and decides execution paths

📴 CERBERUS can run 100% offline, except when using external AI APIs (unless AI is local).

🧠 AI Execution Model

🧠 Cognitive Offloading
Realtime screen states captured in RAM and sent to AI for decisions

🗣️ Semantic Understanding
High-level intent → precise touch automation

🩹 Self-Healing Logic
If AI fails logically, CERBERUS ensures process survival & recovery

🧬 Human-Like Input Engine

🖐️ Proprietary Human Logic Engine

〰️ Bezier-curve swipes (non-robotic motion)
💓 Micro-tremors during holds
⏳ Randomized reaction latency (±12%)
🛡️ Edge protection against system gestures

Built to behave like a real human hand 🕵️‍♂️

⚙️ Compatibility & Architecture

📱 Supported Environments

TrollStore

Dopamine (Rootless / Roothide)

iOS 15 / 16 / 17 / 18

iPhone & iPad

iPad 7th Gen (Palera1n)

🛠️ Admin Daemon

Installed separately (via Filza)

Full privileges

Survives crashes

Detects & exits Safe Mode automatically 🛡️

🧠 Core System Features
1️⃣ Neural Touch Engine 🖐️

Humanized taps, swipes & delays

2️⃣ Visual Cortex (Background OCR) 👁️👁️

🚀 ~20ms latency · software rendering · resolution-agnostic

3️⃣ Deep System Control ⚙️

👻 Persistent daemon
🌉 File-based IPC (ultra stable)
🔓 Native app launching & event injection

🔋 Battery Normalization
Maintains 50–80% battery to simulate human usage

⏳ Kernel Uptime Randomization
Keeps realistic uptime (10–40 days)

📜 Scripting Engine

CERBERUS uses a simple proprietary scripting format designed to be:

Easy for humans

Easy for AI

Extremely stable

Complex scripting languages were intentionally avoided.

🎮 Example Script
name: RealExampleScriptShowcaseV1
loop: true
loopTimes: -1
defaultDelay: 0
applaunch: com.xxxxx.xxxxxx
ocr:Login
swipe:0.5,0.8|0.5,0.2|0.5
find:BANNED|shortcuts://run-shortcut?name=BAN
tap:0.16,0.73
lock
home
volumeUp
volumeDown
ocr:Explore>delay:2

🔋 Resource Efficiency

📉 Dynamic frequency scaling (0% CPU when idle)
🧹 Automatic memory recycling for 24/7 operation
🔋 Optimized for minimal battery drain
